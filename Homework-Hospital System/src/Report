1-System Design:

the objective of this project was to simulte a Hospital Patient Management System by integrating fundamental data structure.
The system architecture is based on a central HospitalSystem class that manages four different components:

*Linked list: LinkedLİst's purpose is that keep the patients who accept

*Queue: it manages to flow of the patient who wait treatment

*Stack: it hides discharge records and acces the last patient with LIFO principle

*HashMap: By mapping PatientID to Patient Objects, it enables access to patient details at O(1) speed during treatment and discharge
processes. Thus, there is no need for slow O(N) searches in the linked list.

2-Algorithm:

A(Priority mechanism):
I applied two queue from TreatmentQueue class instead of one list.
Class keeps two LinkedList for priority and normal situation.

Performance:

*Enqueue: when a request was add, firstly check priority situation and request is add on end of the list. this procces is O(1).

*Dequeue: System always check out beginning of the priority queue. if there is not empty, take from there. if not take beginning of the normal queue.
this procces is O(1).

*Result: if I used the just one list, when I searched the most severity, the proccess will be O(N). My approach is faster than it

B(Sort mechanism):
I used bubblesort for my sort mechanism

*logic mechanism: the algorithm wanders the Linked list and compare the nodes thats stay side by side according to the severity and if the sorting is wrong, swap them.

*performance: on the worst scenario. algorithm is work nested loop and this procces is O(N^2).

3-Performance analyse:

A(Data Structures Analysis):

*LinkedList: Adding a patient is O(1) because I utilized a tail pointer. However, searching and removing require traversing the list, resulting in O(N) complexity.

B(Priority Mechanism):

*My implementation maintains two separate queues for Emergency and Normal patients.

*Both adding (enqueue) and processing (dequeue) requests operate in O(1) time.

*This is structurally superior to a single-list approach, which would require an O(N) linear search to find the highest-priority patient every time.

C(Sorting):

*The sorting algorithm runs in O(N^2) time due to nested loops swapping adjacent nodes.

D(Optimization):

*To mitigate the O(N) lookup cost of the Linked List, I integrated a HashMap. This reduced patient retrieval times for treatment and discharge operations from O(N) to O(1).
