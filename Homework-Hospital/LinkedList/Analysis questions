1.Question: Explain the Big O time complexity for addPatient, removePatient and findPatient

Answer:
1-addPatient method: this method's purpose is adding new patient on the end of the list. there is not necessary scan the list from
beginning to end, because of there is tail value that keep end of the list
*if the list empty, head and tail assing new element
*else only tail.next is updating and tail reference is bought forward
In both cases, a fixed amount of transactions is made, so method's time complexity is O(1).

2-removePatient method: this method checks each patient on the list in order to determine the location of the patient to be deleted.
the list is goes on until find id that want.
on the worst case;
*the wanted patient can be on the end o fthe list
*or he/she can't be on the list
then method has to wander all of the patients so time complexity is O(n).

3-findPatient method: this method same with removePatient methd so time complexity is O(n).

2.Question: Compare the performance of Lİnked List vs ArrayList for these operations.

Answer: My LinkedLİst that I wrote is more efficient than arraylist. The Lİnked list approach is faster than arrayList,
especially in terms of insertion and deletion operatians at the beginning or end of the list.
for example, in adding to begin of the linkedlist, we create a node and connect it to the first node and this spends just 1 operation.
but on the arraylist, we create an element and add it to first index and another elements shift forward one index. this spends mmany operations.
